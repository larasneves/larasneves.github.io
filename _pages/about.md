**Ph.D. Student** @CMU advised by [Eric P. Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) and @IST, advised by  [André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/)

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science jointly at Carnegie Mellon University and Instituto Superior Técnico. My research focuses on **world and agent models**, with a strong emphasis on **reasoning** capabilities and uncertainty quantification in **large language models**. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty-aware learning can enhance reasoning, prediction, and adaptation in dynamic environments.

I completed my MSc in Data Science and Engineering, building on a background in Biomedical Engineering. During my Master's, I developed novel algorithms for online multi-label learning with concept drift, contributing to adaptive, scalable learning systems.
