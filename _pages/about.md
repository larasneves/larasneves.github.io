**Ph.D. Student** @CMU advised by [Eric P. Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) and @IST, advised by  [Andr√© Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/)

As a **Biomedical and Data Science Engineer**, I focus on uncertainty quantification, conformal prediction, and large language models, with applications in biology and healthcare.
Previously, I conducted research on adaptive learning and data stream mining, exploring how models evolve in dynamic environments.
