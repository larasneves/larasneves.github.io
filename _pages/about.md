**Ph.D. Student** @CMU advised by [Eric P. Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) and @IST, advised by  [André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/)

As a PhD student in Computer Science, my research focuses on world models and agent models, with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification, conformal prediction, and large language models. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty-aware learning can strengthen reasoning, prediction, and adaptation in dynamic environments.

I completed my MSc in Data Science and Engineering, building on a background in Biomedical Engineering. During my Master’s, I developed novel and adaptive algorithms for online multi-label learning with concept drift, which led to publications and research collaborations. 

My current work bridges machine learning methodology with the study of robust, trustworthy AI systems, aiming to advance foundations for general-purpose intelligence.
