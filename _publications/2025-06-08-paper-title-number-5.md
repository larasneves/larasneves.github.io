excerpt: 'This paper presents iHOMER, a novel framework for online multi-label learning in dynamic environments. iHOMER is the first incremental, drift-aware algorithm that partitions the label space into correlated clusters without requiring predefined hierarchies. It adapts to concept drift over time, balances scalability and predictive performance, and employs statistical tests to guide both splitting and merging of label clusters.'
