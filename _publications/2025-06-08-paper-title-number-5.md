title: "Online Hierarchical Partitioning of the Output Space in Extreme Multi-Label Data Streams"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This paper presents iHOMER, a novel framework for online multi-label learning in dynamic environments. iHOMER is the first incremental, drift-aware algorithm that partitions the label space into correlated clusters without requiring predefined hierarchies. It adapts to concept drift over time, balances scalability and predictive performance, and employs statistical tests to guide both splitting and merging of label clusters.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
